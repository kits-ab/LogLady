# 4. Use of Fabric UI as design system

Date: 2019-12-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Can development be made easier and design be improved by using a design system with pre-made components and design guidelines?

## Decision

We will use [Fabric UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric#/) as our design system.

The closest competitor to Fabric UI was Material UI, but Fabric UI was chosen due to it having an already bundled effective list renderer, good support for theming, amny components and a good license (MIT). Each component in Fabric UI is also accompanied by a series of do's and don'ts, making it easier to make informed design decisions as a developer.

## Consequences

A more cohesive design of the application and quicker development with pre-made components.
