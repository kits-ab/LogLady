# 2. use gitflow and naming

Date: 2019-02-26

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need a strategy for how to git and name branches

## Decision

Tasks can be found in [Projects](https://github.com/kits-ab/LogLady/projects/1).

 Assign one to yourself then create branch from develop and name it like this: feature/whetever-you-are-doing-#corresponding-task-ID

Example: `feature/branchName-#5`

**Note:** _feature_ is an example, it could be:

- feature
- hotfix
- release

Commit messages should start with task ID.
Example: `#5 update README. Explained naming.`

Push when done. Make pull request where you add task ID to beginning of comment.

## Consequences

Tracking backlog items, branches and pull requests becomes easier.
